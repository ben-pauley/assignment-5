# assignment-5

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed assignment for week 6 of the programme. My task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. I believe I was very successful in meeting the required criteria.

## Installation

Nothing is required to install my project, but the project is deployed live at this URL: https://ben-pauley.github.io/assignment-5/.

## Software Used

This project was completed using Visual Studio Code and I tested the website using Google Chrome. The assignment was largely completed using JavaScript, jQuery and the Moment.js library.

## Conclusion

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of completing this assignment. I learned a lot about jQuery along the way and feel a lot more comfortable in all the concepts explored during the creation of the solution for this assignment. This allowed me lots of time to improve and refine my code to make it as DRY and efficient as I could, and in the future, I would like find a solution to the problem I encountered shown in my comments in my JavaScript file.
